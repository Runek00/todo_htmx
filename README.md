# todo_htmx
My first attempt at htmx and thymeleaf

It's a TODO list, duh.

I've never used Thymeleaf. Never used htmx either. I barely even use github.
Inspired by this article: https://dev.to/aussieguy/full-stack-web-development-in-a-single-java-file-an-intro-to-javalin-and-htmx-2ich
but I used Spring Boot (I know it a fair bit) and Thymeleaf (never even touched it). Pretty much done. I might extend it in the future.
